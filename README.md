# House-Price-Estimation-with-Regularization-Techniques

###  Project Overview

This project is part of an advanced regression assignment for a data science program. A U.S.-based housing company, **Surprise Housing**, is planning to enter the Australian real estate market. Their strategy is to buy properties priced below their actual value and resell them for a profit.

To support this strategy, the company collected data on housing prices in Australia and tasked us with building a **regression model using regularization** to predict actual house prices.

---

### Objective

Build and evaluate Ridge and Lasso regression models to:

- Identify significant variables affecting house prices
- Understand how well those variables describe house prices
- Find the **optimal value of lambda** (regularization strength) for both models
- Provide actionable insights for the company’s investment strategy

---

### Business Understanding

The model aims to:

- Help Surprise Housing make informed investment decisions in the Australian market
- Understand the influence of different features on house prices
- Identify undervalued properties for profitable flipping


### Key Concepts Covered

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature selection
- Train-test splitting
- Linear regression recap
- Regularization (Ridge & Lasso)
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Model evaluation (R² score, RMSE, etc.)
